Just a simple tool to save the file btime (birth time) to the xattrs while waiting for this:

```
$ stat file
...
Access: ....
Modify: ....
Create: .... <-- this
Change: ....
 Birth: ....
```

### Reason
how the hell is the creation timestamp of a file (NOT of the inode) not a thing yet, in the same way `mtime` is a thing and is carried over even through web downloads.
